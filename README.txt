This is the Starter Project, which is intended to be a core learning asset for the students
who have enroled the Design and Testing subject of the Software Engineering curriculum of the 
University of Sevilla.  This project helps them start working on their new information system 
projects.

In this project, we have added the possibility for an authenticated user to be a manager, the system can store shouts, it can also store tasks, and an administrator has a dashboard of system data.

For the project, we have decided to create branches in github for each task that we expose in the tasks section of the project, we have decided to work in pairs, so we have divided those tasks in those subgroups and we have worked on them.

the final branch for deliveries will be master, and it will be 1.0.0.
